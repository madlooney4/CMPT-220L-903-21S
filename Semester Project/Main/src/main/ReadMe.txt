The main objective of this project is to demonstrate knowledge of Java programming and to implement all functionality for a binary Search Tree.

=========================================================================================
The main functionality of this BST project:

-- Creating a Node:  In this function, we create a new node. We set data for new node, like the left and right child for the node. 
-- Inserting a new Node: In this function, we insert node data of integer data type. 
		The Smaller value is placed towards the left child of the parent node and the greater value of the node from the parent is placed towards the right, which constructs a binary search Tree. 
-- Finding Elements: This function searches for the specific integer value in the binary search tree.
-- Finding Height of the BST: This function finds the height of the binary search tree.
-- Finding Minimum Element in the BST: This function finds the smallest element in the binary search tree, which is found in the left sub tree. 
-- Finding Largest Element in the BST: This function finds the largest element in the binary search tree, which is found in the right sub tree.
-- Finding Nth Largest Element in the BST: This function finds the Nth largest element in the binary search tree.
-- Deleting the specific Element in the BST: This function deletes the element in the binary search tree. 
		This function looks for three cases:
			First Case: Node which has no child.
			Second Case: Node which has only one child.
			Third Case: Node which has two child. 
-- Tree Traversing
		Inorder Traversing: This function shows the elements of the BST in Ascending order. 
		PreOrder Traversing: This function shows the elements of the BST through Recursively call. 
		Post Order Traversing: This function shows the elements of the BST through Recursively call. 
-- Advanced Search
		Bredth First Search: This search uses the queue for visited nodes.
		Depth First Search: This search uses the stack for visited nodes.

How to use this BST project: 

1. The system needs to have a standard IDE for Java. 
2. Open the project folder in the Java IDE and configure the three files. 
3. Compile the project and then run it.
