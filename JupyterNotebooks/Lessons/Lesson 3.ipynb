This becomes relevant as we start to develop more pure scripts we have to move away from our GUIs.\n",

That being said I'm assuming that you're using powershell if you're on Windows. Before we get into that we're going to talk paths. Below we have a couple paths and what you need to understand is that `/` and `\\` denotes that you're going down a level in the folder or that you're going inside of that folder.\n",
